ARM templates visualizer

## Our goal
We decided to create new ARM visualizer(apart from currently existing ones like ARMVIZ) because there's no tool, which is being currently maintained and developed. Our goal is to provide a solution, which will fill the gap of ARM visualizers and help people when working with them on daily basis.

## How can I help?
Anyone can join and we'll welcome all new contributors. Currently we need people for all kinds of different things:
* coding
* documentation
* testing
* UI
* ideas  

if you feel you could help, please either post an issue in this repo or join our chat on Gitter.
